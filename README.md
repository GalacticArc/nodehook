# nodehook
This is a node software to make it quicker to make simple applications.

The modules require a format that allows for an object orientated way or programming. 

There are 4 things the modules can have:
 - (Required) A table that defines the module and requirements. (Specifically exports.module, see example.js for reference.)
 - A pre-initialization function, this allows to setup things for going live. (exports.module.preinit)
 - A initialization function, which is run to go live. (exports.module.init)
 - A close function which will run when the process needs to shutdown properly. Does not get called when the process is killed.

There are a few command line arguments you can use on the moduleloader.js.

port - Used for defining what port the http uses. E.g port=80 (Requires your module to use global.server.webport when hooking the port.)

id - The unique indentification for logging when in multi-process mode. E.g id=server1

skip - This is for skipping specific module names, does not stop from requiring, only running the 3 module functions. E.g skip=httphandler,mysqlhook
